# unimrcp_experiments

## Overview

Here we have a Dockerfile to create a container that will host unimrcp and swig-wrapper (modules to permit to call unimrcp library using python, java, csharp).

This will permit to get some experience with unimrcp.

The unimrcp is an MRCP server that can be extended with plugins that permit to access TTS and ASR services from providers like google, amazon, azure etc.

## Building the image

To build the container image:
```
./build_image.sh
```
Be patient as this will take several minutes (more than 7 minutes in my machine).

## Starting the container

To start the container do:
```
./start_container.sh
```

The container will be started with option '--network host' so that we can use mrcp clients running outside the container and listen to audio generated by unimrcp.

## Starting a tmux working session

Do:
```
./tmux_session.sh
```

The above will open a tmux session as defined in tmux_session.yml.

There will be one window called 'unimrcpserver' that will have unimrcpserver running and outputting logs.

There will be another window called 'bin+sngrep2' with 2 panes:
  - one pane will be open at /usr/local/unimrcp/bin
  - the other pane will be running sngrep2

And there will be another window called "root" with 2 panes:
  - one pane will be open at the root of the repo ~/src/git/unimrcp_experiments
  - the other pane will be running sngrep2

The unimrcp is installed on /usr/local/unimrcp. In addition to the bin folder with the executables, you will also see subfolders for configuration (conf) and plugins.

The unimrcp comes with demosynth (TTS) and demorecog (ASR) plugins for testing purposes.

As the names imply, they are demo plugins and don't actually generate/process speech. Instead they output results (speech or text) from static sources.

## Testing with mrcp_client

Outside the container (so that you can have access to audio devices), you can use an MRCP client like https://github.com/MayamaTakeshi/mrcp_client to talk with unimrcpserver (it listens to SIP port 8060)

and test Speech Synth:
```
node speechsynth_client.js 127.0.0.1 8060 en-US somevoice "Hello World"
```
or Speech Recog:
```
node speechrecog_client.js 127.0.0.1 8060 en-US artifacts/hello_there.wav builtin:speech/transcribe
```

## Testing with umc and unimrcpclient

These are MRCP clients that come as part of unimrcp.

Switch to the window "bin+sngrep2" and start umc like this:
```
cd /usr/local/unimrcp/bin
./umc
```
Then execute commands like:
```
run synth
```
or
```
run recog
```

Check the messages exchanged at the sngrep2 pane.

You can also use unimrcpclient and do the same commands (I don't know what is the difference between umc and unimcrpclient).

# Building minimal_app

We have a minimal app code showing how to compile and link against the unimrcp library.

The app does nothing. It is just a build smoke test to confirm we can compile and link against unimrcp libs.

To build it:
```
cd minimal_app/
rm CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/ cmake_install.cmake -fr
cmake -D USER=`whoami` .
make
```
Sample execution:

```
MayamaTakeshi@takeshi-desktop:unimrcp_experiments$ cd minimal_app/
MayamaTakeshi@takeshi-desktop:minimal_app$ rm CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/ cmake_install.cmake -fr
MayamaTakeshi@takeshi-desktop:minimal_app$ cmake -D USER=`whoami` .

```

You can run the app by doing:
```
./app
```

Ex:
```
MayamaTakeshi@takeshi-desktop:minimal_app$ ./app 
OK
```

## Testing with swig-wrapper

Swig is a tool that generates wrappers around C/C++ libraries so that they can be called by other programming languages.

The swig-wrapper for unimrcp was installed and built at /usr/local/src/git/swig-wrapper

### Python

To test Speech Synth with the swig-wrapper for python do:
```
./UniSynth.py "hello"
```
The above will produce a file UniSynth.pcm that you can move to a folder visible to the host and then you can use 
```
ffplay -f s16le -ar 8k -ac 1 UniSynth.pcm 
```
in the host to hear it.

Then to test Speech Recog with the swig-wrapper for python do:
```
./UniRecog.py /usr/local/unimrcp/data/grammar.xml UniSynth.pcm
```

But again, the output for both synth and recog is bogus as we are using the demo plugins.

### Java

```
sudo su
cd /usr/local/src/git/swig-wrapper/Java/
./UniSynth.sh hello
```

Obs: the communication with unimrcp will not be captured by sngrep2 because this uses MRCP v1 which doesn't use SIP as session negotiation protocol.

### CSharp
```
sudo su
cd /usr/local/src/git/swig-wrapper/CSharp
./UniSynth.sh hello
```

However, it currently fails:
```
root@takeshi-desktop:/usr/local/src/git/swig-wrapper/CSharp# ./UniSynth.sh hello
Mono runtime: /usr/bin/mono
Using C# compiler: /usr/bin/mcs

### Sample apps in C and Cpp
The swig-wrapper repo also contains samples in C and Cpp

#### C

```
sudo su
cd /usr/local/src/git/swig-wrapper/C
./UniSynth_C hello
```
Obs: the communication with unimrcp will not be captured by sngrep2 because this uses MRCP v1 which doesn't use SIP as session negotiation protocol.

#### Cpp
```
sudo su
cd /usr/local/src/git/swig-wrapper/Cpp
./UniSynth_Cpp hello
```

Obs: the communication with unimrcp will not be captured by sngrep2 because this uses MRCP v1 which doesn't use SIP as session negotiation protocol.

## Testing plugins written in rust

There are some plugins written in rust available at github:

  https://github.com/akmitrich/rsunimrcp_tts # equivalent of demosynth plugin.

  https://github.com/akmitrich/rsunimrcp_asr # equivalent of demorecog plugin.

Let's test them as they will be useful as reference when writing our own plugins.

However, since the original repositories might be deleted by the owner, I have forked them.

So do:
```
cd ~/src/git
git clone https://github.com/MayamaTakeshi/rsunimrcp_tts
cd rsunimrcp_tts
cd checkout fee5d1423add2f0001056456c6d9a41419701066

cd ~/src/git
git clone https://github.com/MayamaTakeshi/rsunimrcp_asr
cd rsunimrcp_asr 
git checkout d052b0071efcb8a582d451b57300506b90e8160e
```

Let's build and install them:
```
cd ~/src/git/rsunimrcp_tts
cargo build
sudo cp -f target/debug/librsunimrcp_tts.so /usr/local/unimrcp/plugin/

cd ~/src/git/rsunimrcp_asr
cargo build
sudo cp -f target/debug/librsunimrcp_asr.so /usr/local/unimrcp/plugin/
```
Now open /usr/local/unimrcp/conf/unimrcpserver.xml as root/sudo and replace:
```
      <engine id="Demo-Synth-1" name="demosynth" enable="true">
      <engine id="Demo-Recog-1" name="demorecog" enable="true"/>
```
with:
```
      <engine id="RS-Synth" name="librsunimrcp_tts" enable="true">
        <param name="filename" value="/usr/local/unimrcp/data/demo-8kHz.pcm"/>
      </engine>
      <engine id="RS-Recog" name="librsunimrcp_asr" enable="true">
        <param name="filename" value="output.pcm"/>
      </engine>      
```

Now go to window tmux 'unimrcpserver' and press 'Ctrl-C' to stop unimrcpserver and restart it by inputting:
```
sudo ./unimrcpserver
```

You should see logs like these:
```
2025-08-30 11:18:30:653772 [INFO]   Load Plugin [RS-Synth] [/usr/local/unimrcp/plugin/librsunimrcp_tts.so]
2025-08-30 11:18:30:654466 [INFO]   Register MRCP Engine [RS-Synth]
2025-08-30 11:18:30:654480 [INFO]   Load Plugin [RS-Recog] [/usr/local/unimrcp/plugin/librsunimrcp_asr.so]
2025-08-30 11:18:30:654949 [INFO]   Register MRCP Engine [RS-Recog]

2025-08-30 11:18:30:655499 [INFO]   Start Task [Rust TTS-Engine]
2025-08-30 11:18:30:656423 [INFO]   Start Task [Rust ASR-Engine]
```

which confirms we loaded and started the Rust plugins.

Now you can use any of the MRCP client apps mentioned before and the request will be processed by the rust plugins.

For a quick test you can do these from your mrcp_client folder at your PC (outside of the container):
```
$ node speechrecog_client.js 127.0.0.1 8060 en-US artifacts/hello_there.wav builtin:speech/transcribe

$ node speechsynth_client.js 127.0.0.1 8060 en-US somevoice "Hello World"
```
But the same way as the original demosynth and demorecog plugins, they generate fake results as they get data from static sources.

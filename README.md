# unimrcp_experiments

## Overview

Here we have a Dockerfile to create a container with unimrcp and swig-wrapper.

You will need to have docker and jq installed:
```
apt install docker jq
```

## Building the image

To build the container image:
```
./build_image.sh
```

## Starting the container

To start the container do:
```
./start_container.sh
```

The container will be started with '--network host' (and unimrcpserver.xml and unimrcpclient.xml will be configured with 'ip type="lo"') so that we can use mrcp clients running outside the container and listen to audio generated by unimrcp.


## Starting the server

To start the unimrcp server do:
```
cd /usr/local/unimrcp/bin
./unimrcpserver
```

## Testing with mrcp_server:

Then you can use https://github.com/MayamaTakeshi/mrcp_client like this:
```
node speechsynth_client.js 127.0.0.1 8060 en-US somevoice "Hello World"
```
or
```
node speechrecog_client.js 127.0.0.1 8060 en-US artifacts/hello_there.wav builtin:speech/transcribe
```

However the above will actually generate dummy results as unimrcpserver is configured to use the demo synth and demo recog plugins.

## Testing with umc

You can also test with umc. Start it like this:
```
cd /usr/local/unimrcp/bin
./umc
```
Then execute commands like:
```
run synth
```
or
```
run recog
```


# Building minimal_app

To build the minimal_app (the app does nothing. It is just a build smoke test) do:

```
takeshi@unimrcp_dev:~$ cd ~/host/unimrcp_experiments/minimal_app/
takeshi@unimrcp_dev:~/host/unimrcp_experiments/minimal_app$ 

takeshi@unimrcp_dev:~/host/unimrcp_experiments/minimal_app$ rm CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/ cmake_install.cmake -fr
takeshi@unimrcp_dev:~/host/unimrcp_experiments/minimal_app$ cmake -D USER=`whoami` .

```

You can run the app by doing:
```
takeshi@unimrcp_dev:~/host/unimrcp_experiments/minimal_app$ ./app 
OK
```

## Testing with swig-wrapper

To test Speech Synth with the swig-wrapper for python do:
```
PYTHONPATH=~/src/git/swig-wrapper/Python/wrapper ~/host/unimrcp_experiments/UniSynth.py "hello"
```
The above will produce a file UniSynth.pcm that you can move to a folder visible to the host and then you can use 
```
ffplay -f s16le -ar 8k -ac 1 UniSynth.pcm 
```
in the host to hear it.

Then to test Speech Recog with the swig-wrapper for python do:
```
PYTHONPATH=~/src/git/swig-wrapper/Python/wrapper ~/host/unimrcp_experiments/UniRecog.py /usr/local/unimrcp/data/grammar.xml UniSynth.pcm
```

But again, the output for both synth and recog is bogus as we are using the demo plugins.


## Starting a working session

To simplify opening apps, there is a tmuxinator session definition file that can be used like this:
```
cd ~/host/unimrcp_experiments
tmuxinator start -p unimrcp_dev.yml
```

The above will open a tmux session and will start unimrcpserver and sngrep with MRCP parsing support.
